# Validators:
1. [v-html](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)
    # I used this validator to double check my HTML file. My contact file came up with the most errors of fifteen. Thirteen of which were from the bootstrap link I used to get the name bar, email bar, and message bar. It was a great resource to try and getting the html to look better and be more organized. 

2. [emulator](http://www.viewportemulator.com/devices/apple/iphone-5s/)
    # I used this emulator to test responsiveness on cell phones. I chose to use the Iphone 5s to test the responsiveness of my portfolio. I found a lot of challenges to it but when I was ablt to get it to work I was extremely happy.
