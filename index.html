                    Hello! I am Clint Rizzo, I am 28 years old, and grew up in California. My faviorite hobbies are playing ice hockey, watching hockey, and painting little miniatures from lord of the rings. I am also married and have four huskies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I currently work at Hajoca which is a plumbing warehouse but I am looking to get into a job where I can do web development or some kind of software development. I am currently attending a six month boot camp with Trilogy online with UCI.
                    <br>
                    <br>I got into coding when I started looking over my buddies shoulder and started asking questions. That sparked my interest in coding and decided that I wanted to learn. He gave me a book on python and I just started going through
                    it and fell in love with this type of work. I am excited to continue to learn and it is even more exciting when you get stuck on a problem and figure it out!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The languages that we are currently working on in school is HTML, CSS, and just started working on javascript. We built a little rock, paper, scissors game using prompts and alerts to play a 10 round game. I am looking to expand on the game and make a
                    website where you can select your hand by pressing an image of a rock, paper, or scissor. Have a 10 round game still with a total count at the top. I am excited to design the page so I can start adding projects into my portfolio.
                </p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 ">
                <!--changed first col size to fit when screen is condensed down-->
                <p>Check out the rest of the page! Future things I would like to add to this site is getting the contact file to function so I can receive messages to my email and adding projects to my portfolio page.
