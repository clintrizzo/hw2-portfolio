# languages used:
    1. HTML 
    2. CSS

# project:
1. About Me page features:
   1. I built this project to showcase my projects and give possible future employeers a quick synopsis of who I am and what i've been doing to become more career ready. The page technically has four links, using three html pages and one style sheet. The html files were linked to a nav bar at the top of the page and all are active. I set up for my name to be clickable and it returns the user back to the about me page. 
   2. All nav bars on the page were created using bootstrap. I changed the links to match my html links.
   3. This site was tested on an iphone 5s using an emulator.
   
2. Portfolio page features:
   1. Technically this page is still under construction. My plan for this page is to add a screen shot of the project and link in on the images to the repositories from github. 
   
3. Contact page features:
   1. This page gave me the most headache. Mostly because when trying to the page to respon to the iphone 5s the contact sheets and images I added did not want to fit on the page and wanted to overlap. I added a media screen for that section on the style sheet and it ended up working out really great.
   2. The first feature of this page is that I added my linkedin page and github page. I linked both pages to the images that are in the first column. 
   3. The next feature I used bootstrap to set up the interactiveness for users to put their name, email, and a message. The submit button works and "submits" the information"
   
4. Style sheet:
   1. I divided the style sheet with comments showing where each html file is linked to the style sheet. The navbar and footer are the same style for each link.

# Validators:
1. [v-html](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)
    - I used this validator to double check my HTML file. My contact file came up with the most errors of fifteen. Thirteen of which were from the bootstrap link I used to get the name bar, email bar, and message bar. It was a great resource to try and getting the html to look better and be more organized. 

2. [emulator](http://www.viewportemulator.com/devices/apple/iphone-5s/)
    - I used this emulator to test responsiveness on cell phones. I chose to use the Iphone 5s to test the responsiveness of my portfolio. I found a lot of challenges to it but when I was ablt to get it to work I was extremely happy.
